# ML18SP-Project-1

The project 1 of course Machine Learning in Spring 2018.

1. projectYF.py contains MyGMM, which only supports RGB now.
2. You will need to install the library "skimage" since I use some filters in this library to preprocess the input RGB image.
3. You can envalute the function based on all 3 types of filtering - mean, median or no filter.
   This is because though I have done a lot of tests to determine main parameters in this MyGMM, I cannot determine which filter to use. It is hard to decide which is better by my eyes.
